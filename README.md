## 💡 Introduction
SimWorld is built on Unreal Engine 5 and offers core capabilities to meet the needs of modern agent development. It provides:
- Realistic, open-ended world simulation with accurate physics and language-based procedural generation.
- Rich interface for LLM/VLM agents, supporting multi-modal perception and natural language actions.
- Diverse and customizable physical and social reasoning scenarios, enabling systematic training and evaluation of complex agent behaviors like navigation, planning, and strategic cooperation.

## 🏗️ Architecture
<p align="center">
    <img width="799" height="671" alt="image" src="https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/2e67356a-7dca-4eba-ab57-de1226e080bb" />
</p>

**SimWorld** consists of three layers:
- the Unreal Engine Backend, providing diverse and open-ended environments, rich assets and realistic physics simulation;
- the Environment layer, supporting procedural city generation, language-driven scene editing, gym-like APIs for LLM/VLM agents and traffic simulation;
- the Agent layer, enabling LLM/VLM agents to reason over multimodal observations and history while executing actions via a local action planner.

SimWorld's architecture is designed to be modular and flexible, supporting an array of functionalities such as dynamic world generation, agent control, and performance benchmarking. The components are seamlessly integrated to provide a robust platform for **Embodied AI** and **Agents** research and applications.

## ⚙️ Setup
### Installation
#### Step 1. Install the Python Client

Make sure to use Python 3.10 or later.
```bash
git clone https://github.com/SimWorld-AI/SimWorld.git
cd SimWorld
conda create -n simworld python=3.10
conda activate simworld
pip install -e .
```

#### Step 2. Download the UE Server Package.

Download the SimWorld server executable from [huggingface](https://huggingface.co/datasets/SimWorld-AI/SimWorld/tree/main) and extract it. Choose the version according to your OS and the edition you want to use.

We provide two UE packages: **Base** (an empty map with a smaller download; best for core feature development and testing; supports procedural city generation) and **Additional Environments (100+ Maps)** (a much larger download that includes 100+ ready-to-use maps for diverse scenarios and demos).

| Platform | Package | Scenes/Maps Included | Download | Notes |
| --- | --- | --- | --- | --- |
| Windows | Base | Empty map for procedural city generation | [Download](https://huggingface.co/datasets/SimWorld-AI/SimWorld/resolve/main/Base/Windows.zip) | Smaller download; recommended for development/testing. |
| Linux | Base | Empty map for procedural city generation | [Download](https://huggingface.co/datasets/SimWorld-AI/SimWorld/resolve/main/Base/Linux.zip) | Smaller download; recommended for development/testing. |
| Windows | Additional Environments (100+ Maps) | 100+ pre-built maps (including the empty one) | [Download](https://huggingface.co/datasets/SimWorld-AI/SimWorld/tree/main/AdditionEnvironmentPaks/Windows) | Larger download; best for demos and diverse scenes. |
| Linux | Additional Environments (100+ Maps) | 100+ pre-built maps (including the empty one) | [Download](https://huggingface.co/datasets/SimWorld-AI/SimWorld/tree/main/AdditionEnvironmentPaks/Linux) | Larger download; best for demos and diverse scenes. |


**Note:**
1. The **Additional Environments (100+ Maps)** package is organized as separate `.pak` files. You can download only the maps you need (instead of the full set) based on your OS. Please check the [documentation](https://simworld.readthedocs.io/en/latest/getting_started/additional_environments.html#usage) for usage instructions, including how to load specific maps and what each `.pak` contains.
2. If you only need core functionality for development or testing, use **Base**. If you want richer demonstrations and more scenes, use the **Additional Environments**.

### Quick Start

We provide several examples of code in `examples/`, showcasing how to use the basic functionalities of SimWorld, including city layout generation, traffic simulation, asset retrieval, and activity-to-actions. Please follow the examples to see how SimWorld works.

#### Step 1. Configuration

SimWorld uses a YAML configuration file to control **global simulator settings** (e.g., `seed`, `dt`, UE blueprint paths) and **module behaviors** (e.g., city generation, traffic simulation, asset retrieval, and agent/LLM options).

- `simworld/config/default.yaml` contains the **built-in defaults** shipped with the package (reference/fallback). We recommend **not editing** this file.
- `config/example.yaml` is a **user template** with placeholders for local paths. Copy it to create your own config.

To set up your own configuration:

1. Create a custom config from the template:
   ```bash
   cp config/example.yaml config/your_config.yaml

2. Modify the configuration values in `your_config.yaml` according to your needs.

3. Load your custom configuration in your code:
   ```python
   from simworld.config import Config
   config = Config('path/to/your_config')    # use absolute path here
   ```

#### Step 2. Start the UE Server
Start the SimWorld UE server first, then run the Python examples.

From the extracted UE server package directory:

- **Windows:** double-click `gym_citynav.exe`, or launch it from the command line:
  ```bash
  .\gym_citynav.exe <MAP_NAME>

- **Linux:** run:
    ```bash
    ./gym_citynav.sh <MAP_NAME>
    ```

If <MAP_NAME> is not specified, the default map (an empty map) will be open.

#### Step 3. Run a Minimal Example

Once the SimWorld UE5 environment is running, you can connect from Python and control an in-world humanoid agent in just a few lines. The full minimal demo is provided in `examples/gym_interface_demo.ipynb`. You can also run other example scripts/notebooks under `examples/`.

```python
from simworld.communicator.unrealcv import UnrealCV
from simworld.communicator.communicator import Communicator
from simworld.agent.humanoid import Humanoid
from simworld.utils.vector import Vector

class Agent:
    def __init__(self, goal):
        self.goal = goal
        self.llm = BaseLLM("gpt-4o")
        self.system_prompt = f"You are an intelligent agent in a 3D world. Your goal is to: {self.goal}."

    def action(self, obs):
        prompt = f"{self.system_prompt}\n You are currently at: {obs}\nWhat is your next action?"
        action = self.llm.generate_text(system_prompt=self.system_prompt, user_prompt=prompt)
        return action

class Environment:
    def __init__(self, comm: Communicator):
        self.comm = comm
        self.agent: Humanoid | None = None
        self.action_planner = None
        self.agent_name: str | None = None
        self.target: Vector | None = None
        self.action_planner_llm = A2ALLM(model_name="gpt-4o-mini")

    def reset(self):
        """Clear the UE scene and (re)spawn the humanoid and target."""
        # Clear spawned objects
        self.comm.clear_env()

        # Blueprint path for the humanoid agent to spawn in the UE level
        agent_bp = "/Game/TrafficSystem/Pedestrian/Base_User_Agent.Base_User_Agent_C"

        # Initial spawn position and facing direction for the humanoid (2D)
        spawn_location, spawn_forward = Vector(0, 0), Vector(0, 1)
        self.agent = Humanoid(spawn_location, spawn_forward)
        self.action_planner = LocalPlanner(agent=self.agent, model=self.action_planner_llm, rule_based=False)

        # Spawn the humanoid agent in the Unreal world
        self.comm.spawn_agent(self.agent, name=None, model_path=agent_bp, type="humanoid")

        # Define a target position the agent is encouraged to move toward (example value)
        self.target = Vector(1000, 0)

        # Return initial observation (optional, but RL-style)
        observation = self.comm.get_camera_observation(self.agent.camera_id, "lit")

        return observation

    def step(self, action):
        """Use action planner to execute the given action."""
        # Parse the action text and map it to the action space
        primitive_actions = self.action_planner.parse(action)

        self.action_planner.execute(primitive_actions)

        # Get current location from UE (x, y, z) and convert to 2D Vector
        location = Vector(*self.comm.unrealcv.get_location(self.agent)[:2])

        # Camera observation for RL
        observation = self.comm.get_camera_observation(self.agent.camera_id, "lit")

        # Reward: negative Euclidean distance in 2D plane
        reward = -location.distance(self.target)

        return observation, reward

if __name__ == "__main__":
    # Connect to the running Unreal Engine instance via UnrealCV
    ucv = UnrealCV()
    comm = Communicator(ucv)

    # Create the environment wrapper
    agent = Agent(goal='Go to (1700, -1700) and pick up GEN_BP_Box_1_C.')
    env = Environment(comm)

    obs = env.reset()

    # Roll out a short trajectory
    for _ in range(100):
        action = agent.action(obs)
        obs, reward = env.step(action)
        print(f"obs: {obs}, reward: {reward}")
        # Plug this into your RL loop / logging as needed
```
