Installation

SimWorld Python Client Library
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

The SimWorld Python Client Library contains code for SimWorld's agent and environment layer. Download the Python library from GitHub: `SimWorld Python Client Library <https://github.com/SimWorld-AI/SimWorld.git>`_

.. code-block:: bash

   git clone https://github.com/SimWorld-AI/SimWorld.git
   cd SimWorld

   # install simworld
   conda create -n simworld python=3.10
   conda activate simworld
   pip install -e .

Unreal Engine Backend
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

First, download and extract the **Base** UE server package for your OS. The Base package includes a lightweight city scene for quickly testing SimWorld’s core features, including core agent interaction and procedural city generation.

* **Base (Required)**

  * **Windows:** `Download <https://huggingface.co/datasets/SimWorld-AI/SimWorld/resolve/main/Base/Windows.zip>`_
  * **Linux:** `Download <https://huggingface.co/datasets/SimWorld-AI/SimWorld/resolve/main/Base/Linux.zip>`_

If you want more pre-built scenes for demos and diverse scenarios, you can optionally install **Additional Environments (100+ Maps)**. This is an add-on map pack that extends the Base installation. Download the maps you need and copy the ``.pak`` files into the Base server folder at: ``SimWorld/Content/Paks/``.

* **Additional Environments (Optional, 100+ Maps)**

  * **Windows:** `Download <https://huggingface.co/datasets/SimWorld-AI/SimWorld/tree/main/AdditionEnvironmentPaks/Windows>`_
  * **Linux:** `Download <https://huggingface.co/datasets/SimWorld-AI/SimWorld/tree/main/AdditionEnvironmentPaks/Linux>`_

The Additional Environments package is organized as separate ``.pak`` files, so you can download only the maps you need. Please check the :doc:`additional_environments` documentation for usage instructions, including how to load specific maps and what each ``.pak`` contains.
