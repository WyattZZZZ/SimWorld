## Make Your Own `.pak` Files
You can create your own .pak files to extend the environment or agent library of SimWorld by following these steps:

**Note:**
- We use Windows for this tutorial, but the steps are similar for Linux.
- If you are on Windows, you can use cross-compiling to build pak files for Linux by refering this document: [Unreal Engine Linux Cross-Compilation](https://dev.epicgames.com/documentation/en-us/unreal-engine/linux-development-requirements-for-unreal-engine?application_version=5.3#cross-compiletoolchain).

### 1. Download the Unreal Editor
Download the Unreal Editor from the [Epic Games Launcher](https://www.unrealengine.com/en-US/download). The Latest version of SimWorld is using Unreal Engine 5.3.2, so make sure to install the same version.

### 2. Create a New Unreal Project
Launch the Unreal Engine and create a new project. Then name the project as `SimWorld` to match the SimWorld structure.

```

**Note:**
Make sure your project has been named as `SimWorld`, otherwise the pak file may not work properly.

### 3. Import Assets
Import your desired assets into the project. You can use assets from the Unreal Marketplace or your own custom assets. Make sure all assets are properly organized in **a same** folder under the `Content` directory.

```

### 4. Setup Chunk Package
Open project settings by navigating to `Edit > Project Settings`. In the Project Settings window, go to the `Packaging` section and enable the `Use Pak File` option, **disenable** `Use Io Store`, and enable `Generate Chunks`.

```

Then, add a `Data Asset` at the directory where you imported your assets. Right-click in the Content Browser, select `Miscellaneous > Data Asset`, and choose `Primary Asset Label` to create a new Data Asset.

```

### 5. Configure Chunk Settings
Open the created Data Asset and set the `ChunkID`. And enable all options under `Primary Asset Label` to make sure all assets under this directory will be included in the pak file.

```{image} ../assets/MYO_6.png
:width: 800px
:align: center
:alt: Configure Chunk Settings
```

**Note:**
The `ChunkID` should be unique and not conflict with existing chunks in SimWorld. You can refer to the [Additional Environments](../getting_started/additional_environments.md) to avoid conflicts.

### 6. Build the Pak File
Finally, package the project by navigating to `Platforms > Windows > Package Project`. Choose a directory to save the packaged project. After packaging is complete, navigate to the saved directory and locate the `.pak` file in the `<Path to your packaged project>/SimWorld/Content/Paks` folder.

```{image} ../assets/MYO_7.png
:width: 800px
:align: center
:alt: Package Project
```

### 7. Use the Pak File in SimWorld
Copy the generated `.pak` file to the `SimWorld/Content/Paks` directory of your SimWorld installation. You can now load the new environment or assets in SimWorld by specifying the corresponding Map URI or asset path. Refer to the [Additional Environments](../getting_started/additional_environments.md) for loading instructions.
